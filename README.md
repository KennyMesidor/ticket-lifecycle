Agents can monitor active tickets from the Agent Panel. Queue managers then assign high-priority tickets to the appropriate agents and ensure that the correct SLAs are applied.

In this scenario, the ticket has been marked as Emergency because it affects a critical area of the business. The SLA plan has been updated to reflect this priority, and the ticket has been assigned to a senior technician. In some ticketing systems, customers also have the ability to select their own SLA plans when submitting a request.

The ticket was closed after determining that the issue stemmed from the customer’s personal network. The status was updated to Resolved, and an internal note was added for Steve Lang, noting that the customer was upset. The note emphasized responding with urgency and empathy during any follow-up communication.
